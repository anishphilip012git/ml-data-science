# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a selection of advanced projects that highlight my expertise in machine learning, data science, and their applications in various domains. Each project involved solving complex problems using state-of-the-art techniques and tools, providing valuable insights and impactful results.

## Projects

### 1. Evaluating Value or Significance of a Place
- **Objective**: This project provides a novel perspective on the importance of small businesses within local communities. By leveraging a dataset that includes government economic census data and customer reviews from platforms like Yelp and Google Local, I developed a success score for small businesses. This score is based on factors such as transit accessibility, pedestrian-friendliness, and the socio-economic context of the area.
- **Highlights**:
  - Developed a multi-faceted success score reflecting the economic, social, and infrastructural impact of businesses.
  - Validated the rankings of businesses in various community districts, particularly in Queens.
- **Technologies & Techniques**:
  - Data Science Fundamentals
  - Machine Learning Applications
  - Clustering Techniques (K-means, DBSCAN)
  - Regression Models (Linear/Logistic/GradientBoost/AdaBoost)
  - Data Analysis
- **Project Link**: [View Project](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishphilip12/details/projects/1709442986008/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAABGGalcBOgCoZ-ElFybA18MJOi1Zq0x7ytE)

### 2. Construction/Implementation and Evaluation of Financial Trading Systems (FTS) Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- **Objective**: This project explores the use of advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to refine stock trading strategies. By implementing and comparing various RL algorithms, including Temporal Q-Learning, LSTM, and K-Line Clustering, I identified effective approaches for optimizing trading outcomes in a dynamic financial environment.
- **Highlights**:
  - Implemented and evaluated price prediction models across single and multiple stock pools.
  - Assessed the performance of LSTM models under different trading scenarios to maximize profitability.
- **Technologies & Techniques**:
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Deep Learning
  - Neural Networks
  - Stock Market Analysis
  - LSTM Models
  - Temporal Q-Learning
  - K-Line Clustering
