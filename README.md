# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a selection of advanced projects that highlight my expertise in machine learning, data science, and their applications in various domains. Each project involved solving complex problems using state-of-the-art techniques and tools, providing valuable insights and impactful results.

## Projects

### 1. Taxi Trip Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
- **Objective**: This project involved comprehensive data analysis and predictive modeling on a large-scale taxi trip dataset. The goal was to clean and preprocess the data, identify and handle outliers, and perform statistical tests and predictive modeling to extract meaningful insights and predictions from the data.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - **Dataset Cleaning**: Removed rows with zero or invalid values and identified missing data points for interpolation.
  - **Outlier Detection**: Applied Tukey’s rule to detect and handle outliers in key columns such as passenger count, trip duration, and fare amount.
  - **Linear Interpolation**: Used linear interpolation to estimate missing values, scaling by trip distance for more accurate predictions.
  - **Statistical Tests**: Conducted Wald’s test, Z-test, t-test, K-S test, and Permutation test to compare distributions and test the equality of means across different time periods.
  - **Linear Regression**: Built predictive models to estimate total trip amounts based on trip duration and distance, and evaluated model performance using SSE and MAPE.
  - **Time Series Analysis**: Applied AR(2), AR(3), EWMA, and SMA methods to predict trip amounts on a day-to-day basis.
  - **Bayesian Inference**: Utilized Bayesian methods to update posterior distributions and predict trip distances with high accuracy.
- **Technologies & Techniques**:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Outlier Detection
  - Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
  - Linear Regression & Time Series Analysis
  - Bayesian Inference
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- **Outcome**: This project provided a deep dive into advanced data processing techniques and statistical modeling, resulting in robust predictive models and insightful statistical comparisons across the dataset.

### 2. Evaluating Value or Significance of a Place
- **Objective**: This project provides a novel perspective on the importance of small businesses within local communities. By leveraging a dataset that includes government economic census data and customer reviews from platforms like Yelp and Google Local, I developed a success score for small businesses. This score is based on factors such as transit accessibility, pedestrian-friendliness, and the socio-economic context of the area.
- **Highlights**:
  - Developed a multi-faceted success score reflecting the economic, social, and infrastructural impact of businesses.
  - Validated the rankings of businesses in various community districts, particularly in Queens.
- **Technologies & Techniques**:
  - Data Science Fundamentals
  - Machine Learning Applications
  - Clustering Techniques (K-means, DBSCAN)
  - Regression Models (Linear/Logistic/GradientBoost/AdaBoost)
  - Data Analysis

### 3. Construction/Implementation and Evaluation of Financial Trading Systems (FTS) Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
- **Objective**: This project explores the use of advanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to refine stock trading strategies. By implementing and comparing various RL algorithms, including Temporal Q-Learning, LSTM, and K-Line Clustering, I identified effective approaches for optimizing trading outcomes in a dynamic financial environment.
- **Highlights**:
